# Bytecode-Differentiation: A simple tool to compute dalvik bytecode differentiation.
This program can be used to calculate the difference of two dalvik Bytecode and it is based on k-gram calculation algorithm.
***
## Functions & Usage

Bytecode-Differentiation takes two .dex file as input then it gives out differentiation score. Input dalvik bytecode can be put into **ClassesFiles** --one to baseline directory and the other to obfuscated directory. **venv** directory contains necessary tools of third-party.
***
1.Put two bytecode files into ClassesFiles;

2.Run with following command.
>python CodePrint.py
